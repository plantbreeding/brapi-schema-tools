# brapi-schema-tools
Tools used to manipulate, extend, convert, and modify the BrAPI Specification documents.

Only the [Java based tools](java/README.md) are available at the moment. 

These consist of a Command Line Interface (CLI) that can generate OpenAPI Specification or 
GraphQL Schema from the BrAPI JSON Schema. 

## BrAPI JSON Schema
The BrAPI JSON Schema is a new way to define the Data and Query model for BrAPI using JSON Schema.

The approach is experimental, but it is likely to be supported in a future release of BrAPI.
PLease go to the 'data-model-separation' branch of BrAPI to see the JSON Schema.
